                So hi, Himitsu here. Learned a lot of things this quarter. It's a bit of a emotional rollercoaster. I had a few problems, defenitely did a lot of stupid stuff. I also had a few triumphs, smart decisions too. I had a little bit of a breakdown this quarter, but I recovered from it. Really, it's more like a 'we got cooked' turned into 'WE ARE SOO BACK!' Again, to reinstate, I learned a lot this quarter. There's the fact I knew how to manage my time just a bit better. There's also the fact I knew how to cooperate with people more. <br><br>

                The activities were... meh. They were fun, sure, but they didn't interest me that much. I was really excited for English month only to find out there isn't story writing... Yeah, sucks a lot. I mean I understand, our beautiful divison office is... currently being busy understaffed. Honestly, I don't get it. We're a specialized high school yet we're not allowed to do special stuff? Where's the special in that? <br><br>

                As for ICT, also kinda boring. I knew all the lessons like last quarter. However, it was fun arguing with Anthony on what's really neccesary. <br><br>

                Expectations. Not much, it's going to be Christmas Break soon. Maybe some intresting topics and activities, I dunno. Either way, that's me for second quarter, see ya on the next!
